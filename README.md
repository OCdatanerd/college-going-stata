## OpenSDP College-Going Pathways (Stata)

This repository contains web guides, Stata data visualization code, and sample
data to help education data analysts answer questions about patterns and trends
in studentsâ€™ on-track status in ninth grade, high school graduation, college
enrollment, college persistence, and patterns and trends along the education
pipeline. The College-Going Pathways materials can also be accessed on the 
OpenSDP website at [opensdp.github.io/analysis](https://opensdp.github.io/analysis).

The code in this repository is based on code from the "Analyze" section of the
[Strategic Data Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use),
modified to work with synthetic data generated by the 
[OpenSDPsynthR](https://github.com/opensdp/OpenSDPsynthR) data simulation engine. The
College-Going Pathways guides and code will also work with college-going
analysis files prepared to the [SDP data specification](https://github.com/strategicdataproject/opensdp/raw/gh-pages/assets/images/sdp_college_going_analysis_file_data_specification.pdf).

Files in this repository are organized into the following folders:

- `docs` contains College-Going Pathways web guides
- `figures` contains college-going charts generated by the Stata do files
- `data` contains a college-going analysis file generated by the
OpenSDPsynthR data simulation package
- `programs` contains do files used to generate the charts and web guides
  - Do files with a `_webdoc` suffix generate both charts and web guides
  using the Stata webdoc package
  - Do files without the `_webdoc` suffix are automatically generated versions 
  of the do files stripped of webdoc commands and markdown content
  - Files with a `.zip` suffix are used for delivering the stripped do
  files through the OpenSDP website.

  Run `run_webdoc.do` to loop through the individual do files, generate the
  guides, and generate stripped and zipped versions of the chart code.

These materials were originally authored by the Strategic Data Project.

[OpenSDP](https://opensdp.github.io) is an online, public repository of analytic
code, tools, and training intended to foster collaboration among education
analysts and researchers in order to accelerate the improvement of our school
systems. The community is hosted by the
[Strategic Data Project](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu), an initiative of the
[Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University](https://cepr.harvard.edu).
We welcome contributions and feedback.
